<p><strong>Goals.</strong> The goal of this computer lab is that you train a segmentation model, fitting its parameters to empirical data, and evaluate its performance. The model that you will train is the Retention&amp;Recognition model (RnR henceforth). You can find a short description of the model in <span class="citation" data-cites="alhama2015should">Alhama, Scha, and Zuidema (<a href="#ref-alhama2015should">2015</a>)</span> and in the slides in the <code>materials/</code> directory. We will use the data and evaluation procedures described in <span class="citation" data-cites="frank2010modeling">Frank et al. (<a href="#ref-frank2010modeling">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements.</strong> You need to write and run codes in python and the core libraries that you will use are: <code>matplotlib</code>, <code>random</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>. If you don’t have these libraries installed you can install them using <code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code>. In case you are not very familiar with drawing plots in python, you might find <a href="http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html">this <code>matplotlib</code> gallery</a> helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Materials</strong> In the <code>materials/src</code> directory, you can see 7 <code>*.py</code> files. These contain the computational model that you will train, the methods to load the empirical data and objects and methods for defining experiments. You don’t need to understand what happens in these files but you can use the functions and classes defined in these files to do this assignment. You will need to use functions defined in for fitting the RnR model with the and algorithms. The main file from which you will be running your code is . This is where you should load the data, instantiate the RnR model and call your optimization functions to train the model. Finally, the file contains an example model that will be described later.</p>
<p>In the <code>materials/data</code> directory, you can find three files, each one containing human responses for each of the three experiments described in <span class="citation" data-cites="frank2010modeling">Frank et al. (<a href="#ref-frank2010modeling">2010</a>)</span>. The name of the file indicates which experiment it corresponds to.</p>
<p><strong>Handing in.</strong> You should deliver a pdf report including the <strong>plots</strong> and <strong>explanations</strong>, and <strong>codes</strong> that you wrote (This could be the pdf version of your notebook) along with the ipython notebook you have worked on and all <strong>source files that you have edited</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="the-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The data</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the goal of this assignment is for you to train and evaluate a computational model for segmentation in Artificial Language Learning. You are provided with the model (the RnR model mentioned above, and seen in the slides), and your task is to fit the parameters of this model (train the model) on the dataset that is provided.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="frank2010modeling">Frank et al. (<a href="#ref-frank2010modeling">2010</a>)</span> present three experiments to study how different factors affect word segmentation. These factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sentence length</strong><br />
This is experiment number 1. In this experiment the number of tokens and the size of the vocabulary are fixed. The sentence length is set to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of tokens</strong><br />
This is experiment number 2. In this experiment the size of the vocabulary and sentence length are fixed. The total number of tokens in the input stream is set to be 48, 100, 300, 600, 900 or 1200.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size of the vocabulary</strong><br />
This is experiment number 3. In this experiment the number of tokens and the length of the sentence are fixed. The vocabulary size is set to be 3, 4, 5, 6 or 9.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each experiment the input stream is generated pseudo-randomly to satisfy the specified criteria. After being exposed to this stream, the participants answer a 2AFC test in which they choose between words and partwords. These responses are collected in three data files. You can find these files in <code>materials/data</code> directory (<code>E1_data.csv</code>, <code>E2_data.csv</code>, <code>E3_data.csv</code>).</p>
<p>To see what the input stream for experiment 1 looks like, you can run the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1">expId <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="co"># Change to 2 or 3 to see the input stream for experiment 2 or 3</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2">exp <span class="op">=</span> Frank2010.experiment(expId)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="cf">for</span> cnd, expcnd <span class="kw">in</span> exp.cnd.items():</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4">    <span class="bu">print</span>(Frank2010.CONDITION[expId] <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;: &quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="bu">str</span>(cnd))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" data-line-number="5">    <span class="bu">print</span>(expcnd.stream)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you instantiate the experiment using <code>exp = Frank2010.experiment(expId)</code>, the data of human responses is already loaded and you can access it as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>exp.expResults</code> is the loaded and processed human response data</p></li>
<li><p><code>exp.expResults.data</code> is a list of tuples containing the condition, subject, and if he/she was correct or not</p></li>
<li><p><code>exp.expResults.performance</code> is performance of each subject for each condition</p></li>
<li><p><code>exp.expResults.avg_performance</code> is average performance of all subjects for each condition</p></li>
<li><p><code>exp.expResults.std_performance</code> is standard deviation of performance of all subjects on each condition</p></li>
<li><p><code>exp.plotPerformance()</code> plots the responses of the humans in the experiment</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-model"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The model</h2>
<p>As mentioned above the RnR model is a probabilistic segmentation model. Given a stream of syllables, it breaks it into segments. The model works based on two probabilities, the recognition probability and the retention probability. You can read more about this model in <span class="citation" data-cites="alhama2015should">Alhama, Scha, and Zuidema (<a href="#ref-alhama2015should">2015</a>)</span>. The recognition and retention probabilities of a segment <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are computed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_{\text{rec}}(s)  =  (1 - B^{\text{activation}(s)}) \cdot D^{\#\text{types}}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_{\text{ret}}(s)  = A^{\text{length}(s)} \cdot  C^{\pi}
\]</span></p>
<p>As you can see. The model involves 4 parameters <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> that should be fitted to the empirical data.</p>
<p>This is an example of how you can instantiate the RnR model in your code, for a given parameter setting:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">rnr_model <span class="op">=</span> RnR.RnRv2(A<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.04</span>, B<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.3</span>, C<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.3</span>, D<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.3</span>, nmax<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">4</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can run the RnR model and see the words it memorizes by running this code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">for</span> cnd, expcnd <span class="kw">in</span> exp.cnd.iteritems():</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">    memory <span class="op">=</span> rnr_model.memorizeOnline(<span class="st">&quot;##&quot;</span>.join(expcnd.stimuli))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="bu">print</span> memory</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In order to test the performance of the model, after each input stream, a list of pairs of sequences consisting of one word and one partword will be given to the model, and it has to decide which of the sequences is more likely to be a word.</p>
<p>These test pairs are stored in <code>expcnd.test</code>. The output of the RnR model consists of a memory of segments, together with their subjective frequencies. In order to convert that output to the probabilities of choosing a test item, we use the Luce rule, which states that, given two alternative options <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> to choose from (sequences in our case), the probability to choose one over the other is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(s_1) = \frac{\text{score}(s_1)}{\text{score}(s_1)+\text{score}(s_2)}\]</span></p>
<p>where score is, in the case of the RnR model, a subjective frequency. In the code, we call the Luce choice rule as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">prob_x, prob_y, chosen <span class="op">=</span> rnr_model.Luce(pair[<span class="dv">0</span>], pair[<span class="dv">1</span>])</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the <code>__main__</code> method of , you can find an example of use of the classes and . Run the code and make sure you understand it before proceeding (you don’t need to understand all code in the modules, just how they can be used).</p>
<h1 id="model-fitting"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Model fitting</h1>
<p>Computational models normally include a set of free parameters. The behaviour of the model changes depending on the values of such parameters. Hence, after choosing a computational model, the next step is to set the parameters of the model so that the behaviour/output of the model is consistent/similar to the phenomenon that is being modelled. This is what we call <em>training</em> or <em>fitting</em> the model.</p>
<h2 id="fitting-a-polynomial"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Fitting a polynomial</h2>
<p>A very simplified classic example of this is when we have a set of points and we want to fit a curve to these points. Say we decide that it should be polynomial with the degree of 2. This gives us the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = Ax^{2} + Bx + C\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are the parameters of the model. Now we have to choose the values of these parameters in order to get a curve that best approximates the data points.</p>
<p>But what do we mean by best approximation? This is what we define with an <em>objective function</em>. The objective function is the function that you try to minimize/maximize during the training phase. In other words, we want to find the parameters values that result in the minimum/maximum possible value for the objective function. That would provide us with the best curve.</p>
<p>In this example, we can define the objective function as the mean of the difference between real value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of the points and the target values <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>, i.e. the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> calculated using the polynomial equation above.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that, depending on the data points, it is not always possible to find the set of parameters that gives us an objective function with minimum possible value (zero in this case).</p>
<div class="question">
<p>In this example, what is the threshold number of data points that would guarantee to have at least one set of parameters that result in the objective function to be zero (i.e. in a curve that passes through all the data points)?</p>
<p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> If you have a model with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> parameters and you have <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> data points, this gives you m equations with n variables (parameters). If <span class="math inline">\(m == n\)</span> then you will find exactly one valid value for each variable (parameter). If <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span> the equations would have more than 1 answer and if <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; n\)</span> there would be no solution at all.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 2:</strong> Consider a linear model, <span class="math inline">\(y = Ax + B\)</span>, where there are two parameters. If you have one point, you can have infinite number of lines that go through the point. If you have two points, there is only one lines that passes both of the points. Then if you add a third point, if it is not on the same line as the first two points, you can not have a line that passes all the three points.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, if we have the model, the objective function, and the data points, how can we find the best set of values for the parameters? The algorithms that are used to find the best set of values for the parameters of a model are called <em>optimization</em> algorithms. In this assignment, you will see two different optimization algorithm, Grid Search and Hill Climbing.</p>
<h2 id="grid-search"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Grid search</h2>
<p>One very trivial way to find the optimal parameter setting is to compute the objective function for all equidistant possible combinations of different values for the parameters, and then choose the combination that gives us the lowest cost<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This simple method is called Grid Search.</p>
<p>In the example model, set <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to a random value, and assume <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can be any real value in the range <span class="math inline">\([-1,1]\)</span>. We have to pick a step size, let’s say 0.1. (Since there are indefinite possible values we pick a step size in order to pick a sample.) Thus we would have 21 possible values for both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
    \{-1,-.9,-.8,0.7,...,0,.1,.2,...,.9,1\}
\]</span> If we take all possible combinations, we would have <span class="math inline">\(21 \times 21\)</span> parameter settings. This gives us a grid as you can see here:</p>

<div class="question">
<p>In the file <code>materials/src/optimization.py</code> you can see the code for the function <code>grid_search</code>. Apply this function on the example problem as described above. Draw a heatmap to show the value of the cost function for different values of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="hill-climbing"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Hill climbing</h2>
<p>There are several methods that help us avoid exploring the whole space of the parameter values, using greedy decisions to directly explore the space in the direction that is more probably closer to the minimum point. One of those is the hill climbing algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Hill climbing</em> is in the family of local search algorithms. The idea behind it is that you start from a random point (where each point is a possible solution for the problem), then you decide in which direction you should change the parameters based on the value of the cost function in the current point and its neighbours. Greedily, in each iteration, you choose the next point to be where the cost function is the lowest.</p>
<p>There exist different versions of this algorithm. Here, we will implement Simple Hill Climbing. Informally, you can think about Simple Hill Climbing as if you were lost in some huge hilly landscape and your goal is to find the highest point. If you follow this algorithm, you would make a step from where you are, in one random direction, and see if you have moved higher. If so, you choose your next random direction from this point; if, instead, the landscape goes down, then you go back where you were and choose another random direction.</p>
<p>Here you see an outline of a python function implementing hill climbing.</p>

<h1 id="training-the-rnr-model"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Training the RnR model</h1>
<p>Now that you know what does it mean to fit a model to some data, you are ready to train the RnR model. In the RnR model, there are 4 parameters to be tuned <span class="math inline">\((A, B, C, D)\)</span>, and they all should be in the range of <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span>. The goal is to set these parameters in a way that this model behaves as similar as possible to humans in doing the segmentation task. The objective function is Pearson’s r, which computes the correlation between the performances of the model and the average performances of humans for different conditions.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Apply grid search to fit the parameters of the RnR model for each of the experiments separately. Choose step size of 0.01 (if this is too slow for your computer, choose a larger step size, such as 0.1, and report it). What is the best correlation that you get? <em>(1 point)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can use <code>exp.pearsonR(performances)</code> to compute the cost.</p>

<p>In this assignment, we have fitted the three datasets independently, so we end up with three different models. What would be a better practice?
