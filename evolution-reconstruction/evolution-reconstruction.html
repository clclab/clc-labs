<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="practicalities"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Practicalities</h2>
<p>In this computer lab you will experiment with simulated evolution and phylogenetic reconstruction: the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of species, simulated genes, or — in the end — language and music. We will work on this computer lab during several lab sessions throughout the course, and indicate which sections you are expected to finish in every lab session. If you don’t manage to finish those sections, you can work on them at home, and ask questions on Canvas/by e-mail or during the next lab.</p>
<h2 id="r"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> R</h2>
<p>We assume you have some basic understanding of programming and R. You will not have to write a lot of code yourself, but you should be able to read and run the scripts that we provide you with. If you have never seen any R code before, it might be useful for you to work through a tutorial, such as the first three pages of <a href="http://projects.illc.uva.nl/LaCo/CLAS/clc13/assignments/deboer13rtutorial.pdf">this tutorial by Bart de Boer</a>. Of course, you can always ask us for help if you are stuck on a particular piece of code!</p>
<h2 id="rstudio"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> RStudio</h2>
<p>We strongly recommend you use a particular environment for running your R code, called RStudio. If you haven’t installed RStudio yet, you should do so by finding the appropriate download of RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) for your operating system on <a href="https://rstudio.com">rstudio.com</a> and following the instructions until you can open the program.</p>
<h2 id="console-scripts"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Console &amp; Scripts</h2>
<p>When you open RStudio, you will find your screen divided into a few different parts. The most important ones that allow you to interact with R are on the left. The bottom left panel, called the <em>Console</em>, is where you can enter commands directly, and where the results of your command will be shown immediately after pressing Enter. When R is ready to accept commands, the <em>Console</em> shows a <code>&gt;</code> prompt. In the <em>Console</em>, you can retrieve commands that you entered previously by using the up arrow key. However, when you close RStudio, all the commands you entered in the <em>Console</em> will be forgotten. When you are using a sequence of multiple commands and/or would like to run your code more often than once, it is better to save them in a <em>Script</em> (a plain text file that contains your code). The top left panel in your RStudio window is the <em>Script editor</em>. Here you can enter commands that will not disappear after you run them (you can run a selected line of code from the <em>Script editor</em> by pressing Ctrl-Enter). The tab at the top of the panel will show the name of your script. R script filenames should end in <code>.R</code>. For the commands given in the labs of this course, we will always tell you if you should enter them in the <em>Console</em> or save them to your <em>Script</em>.</p>
<h2 id="working-directory"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Working directory</h2>
<p>To run a full script in R, you type <code>source(&quot;scriptname&quot;)</code> in the <em>Console</em>. To be able to run a script, it should be available to R. In RStudio, the easiest way to do this is to put them both in the same folder and set this folder as the <em>working directory</em>. In the labs for this course, you should always set your working directory to the folder with materials we provide for that lab (for this lab, that folder is <code>lab-evolution-reconstruction</code>). <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711843-Working-Directories-and-Workspaces">Look at this website</a> to find out how to set the working directory for your version of RStudio.</p>
<h1 id="simulated-evolution"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Simulated Evolution</h1>
<p>The goals of this section are:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>to better understand the concepts of genotype, genotype space, fitness, fitness landscape, selection, mutation, selection-mutation balance, frequency dependent selection;</p></li>
<li><p>to see how these concepts can be formalised in a computer program;</p></li>
<li><p>to appreciate both the power and the limits of natural selection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> You need the following R files in the folder: and <code>auxiliary_functions.R</code> and <code>simulated_evolution.R</code>.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Start RStudio and set the <em>working directory</em> to your locally saved <code>lab-evolution-reconstruction</code> folder.</li>
<li>Open the provided <code>answers_simulated_evolution.R</code> file in the <em>Script editor</em> (click <em>File &gt; Open File…</em> in RStudio). This will be the script to add your code to in this section of the lab.</li>
<li>Install the package <code>stringr</code> by typing <code>install.packages(&quot;stringr&quot;)</code> into the <em>Console</em>.</li>
<li>Load the library <code>stringr</code> by typing <code>library(stringr)</code> in your <em>Script</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Creating a population.</strong> In the first part of this computer lab, we will use R to simulate the evolution of (DNA) strings under a particular fitness function. We will represent DNA strings (the <em>genotype</em>) as a sequence of the letters ‘A’, ‘G’, ‘C’ and ‘U’. In R, you can generate a random sequence of 10 of these letters using the following command (try it out in the <em>Console</em>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&#39;A&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;G&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;C&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;U&#39;</span>), <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>To store the output in a variable (for instance <code>x</code>), you type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&#39;A&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;G&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;C&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;U&#39;</span>), <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then view the contents of a particular variable by simply typing its name (here, <code>x</code>) and pressing Enter. Let’s experiment a bit with this.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using the commands you just learned, generate a few random sequences of length 10 containing the characters ‘A’, ‘G’, ‘C’ and ‘U’ to confirm that it does what we want it to do.</li>
<li>Generate a random sequence of length 50 containing the characters ‘A’, ‘G’, ‘C’ and ‘U’.</li>
<li>The set of all possible sequences is called the <em>genotype space</em>. How big is this space? I.e., how many genotype strings are possible with our representation?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s create a <em>population</em> of DNA strings. To do this, we will make 100 genotype strings. We will store our population in a matrix (the <em>population matrix</em>), where each member of our population is represented as a row of the matrix.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Let’s start with creating a matrix filled with zero’s that we can later fill:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Add this line to your <em>Script</em>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">population &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">matrix</span>(<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">100</span>), <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dv">50</span>)<span class="er">)</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So what do we find in column 30 of our population matrix, and what does this number mean? - Fill your matrix by generating 100 population members in a for-loop and filling the matrix with them<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (also add these lines to your <em>Script</em>):</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Defining a fitness function.</strong> Now we need to define a fitness function that computes the fitness of the individual members of our population. Imagine, for instance, that the string ‘CAC’ codes for some very useful aminoacid. The more CAC’s in the genome, the higher the expected number of offspring. In our simulation of evolution, let’s define the fitness as the number of times the substring ‘CAC’ appears in the genotype string (without overlap, so the string ‘CACAC’ contains <em>one</em> copy of ‘CAC’).</p>
<p>To keep track of the fitness of <em>all</em> members in our population (which are represented as rows in the population matrix), we create a <em>vector</em> where each element of the vector represents the fitness value for one member of the population.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Generate an empty vector to store the fitness values, and call it <code>fitness</code> (add this to your <em>Script</em>):</li>

<p>(Note that <code>R</code> ignores everything that follows the character #. In programming terms, these texts are called <em>comments</em>.) What is the highest possible fitness a member of this population can have? - Compute the mean fitness of your population by using <code>mean(fitness)</code> in your <em>Console</em>. What is the average fitness of your population?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Implementing selection.</strong> Now we will generate the next generation. We assume that each member of the next generation inherits the genome of one of the members of the previous generation. The probability of inheriting each genome is proportional to the genome’s fitness: a child is most likely to inherit the genome of the fittest member of the previous population. This simulates selection.</p>

<h1 id="simulated-evolution-continued"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Simulated evolution with ancestry</h1>
<p>In the previous section we implemented computer simulations of evolution in R. In this section, we extend this simulation, and think about the patterns of genetic variation that the evolutionary process leaves in a population. We look at methods for <em>phylogenetic tree reconstruction</em>. These methods use the genetic variation in the most recent (current) generation to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a population or a set of species. We use a simple clustering algorithm<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.</p>
<p>The goal of this section is to learn about the possibilities and difficulties that are involved in phylogenetic tree reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> You need these two R files in the <code>lab-evolution-reconstruction</code> folder: <code>auxiliary_functions.R</code> and <code>simulated_evolution_ancestry.R</code>. To plot the phylogenetic trees with R, you will also need to have the package <code>ggtree</code>. Install it by typing the following into the <em>Console</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Tracking ancestry.</strong> So far, we have simulated the evolution of strings of symbols, and looked at the effect of different fitness functions. Now we will repeat this simulation, but during the evolutionary process we will keep track of ancestry, so that we can reconstruct family trees of different individuals. We will start with a very simple simulation. The script <code>simulated_evolution_ancestry.R</code> runs the same simulation we saw in the previous part of this lab. This time, however, the script also generates a matrix called <code>parent_matrix</code> that specifies the parent of each member in each generation (where the parent is the individual of the previous generation whose genetic material was inherited). At the end of the simulation, a plot illustrating the development of both the average population fitness and the diversity of the population is generated.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">

<p><strong>Plotting the family tree</strong> Printing the parent matrix for such large simulations is not very helpful, because the network is too dense to properly visualise (you may try if you want). Rather than looking the parent matrix, we will use the parent matrix to reconstruct a <em>family tree</em> for only the last generation (that is, we only look at the members of previous generations whose offspring appears in the last generation.)

<h1 id="phylogenetic-reconstruction-with-r"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Phylogenetic reconstruction of biological data</h1>
<p>In evolutionary research, the elaborate ancestry information represented by the parent matrix is usually not available. To reconstruct family trees we have to resort to different methods. Information about when species branched off (‘speciated’) can be deduced from genetic variation in the current population. For instance, horses are genetically more similar to donkeys than to, say, frogs. So, the last common ancestor of horses and frogs most likely lived much further in the past than the last common ancestor of horses and donkeys. In other words, the branch that would eventually evolve into frogs split off from the branch that would eventually evolve into horses earlier than the branch that would eventually evolve into donkeys. This type of analysis is called phylogenetic reconstruction. It’s based on genetic similarity between members of the current generation, which we measure using a <em>distance measure</em>. There are R packages that can automatically perform this reconstruction. Lets start with installing these packages:</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Open the provided file <code>answers_phylogeny_biological.R</code> in the <em>Script editor</em> (click <em>File &gt; Open File..</em> in RStudio).

</div>
<p>The <code>phangorn</code> package comes with a dataset that contains real genetic data (i.e., RNA samples) from many different species. You can load this dataset by typing the following (add it to your <em>Script</em>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">data</span>(Laurasiatherian)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>To show a summary of the data you can type <code>str(Laurasiatherian)</code> in the <em>Console</em>. The data originates from the (now closed) Allan Wilson Centre in New Zealand. To find out more about this data, have a look at <a href="http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/centres-research/allan-wilson-centre/our-research/resources/software-and-supplementary-materials.cfm">their website</a>.</p>
<p>We will try to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for these species. That is, we will try to reconstruct when different species branched off from each other, based only on genetic information of the current population (the last generation). The first step is to measure ‘genetic distance’ between the genetic samples for each species. For simplicity, we assume that (1) all species ultimately originate from a single common ancestor (an uncontroversial assumption in evolutionary biology), and (2) that species have diverged genetically by picking up mutations at a roughly constant rate (a more problematic assumption). (Try and convince yourself that the phylogenetic tree reconstruction method we described requires the second assumption — and that this assumption is problematic when considering evolution in the real world.)</p>
<p>The distance between strings of DNA or RNA is typically measured by counting the number of mutations required to change one into the other. Because of the second assumption, the genetic distance between two species is proportional to the time that has passed since their last common ancestor.</p>
<div class="question">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Select five species from the Laurasiatherian dataset (for instance three that you think are closely related and two that are more distantly related).</li>

<p>The numbers correspond to the position of the species in the list printed by <code>str(Laurasiatherian)</code>, i.e. Platypus = 1, Possum = 3, etc. ) You have to replace these numbers by the numbers corresponding to the species that you chose. - Verify that your subset contains the right species using the following from the <em>Console</em>:</p>

Why are the numbers on the diagonal of this matrix zero? - Do the computed distances correspond to your intuitions about the selected species’ relatedness? - Using pen and paper, or your favourite drawing software, reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary relations between your selected species. Use the principles described earlier. You shouldn’t need to do any calculations.</p>

<h1 id="phylogenetic-trees-with-hierarchical-clustering"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Phylogenetic trees with hierarchical clustering</h1>
<p><strong>UPGMA.</strong> We can use a simple method called ‘hierarchical clustering’ to build the phylogenetic trees such as in the previous sections automatically. Hierarchical clustering can be done with the UPGMA algorithm. (If you need a refresher on how exactly it worked, look up the UPGMA chapter from the readings again!) In short, UPGMA follows these steps:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Treat each datapoint (for example, a RNA sample of a species) as a separate “cluster” containing just one datapoint;</li>
<li>Compute the distances between all clusters (using some distance measure; for example, genetic distance);</li>
<li>Merge the two clusters that are nearest to each other into a new cluster;</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until only all datapoints are in cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructing a tree.</strong> To construct a phylogenetic tree, we can think of each merging of clusters as the joining of two branches. In the simplest version of this algorithm, we define ‘distance’ between a cluster A and a cluster B as the average distance between any datapoint in A and any datapoint in B — this is what UPGMA does. A slightly more complicated method, Ward’s clustering, uses the square root of the average of the squared point-to-point distances.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Using the distances between species in <code>mysubset</code> (from the distance matrix you computed in the previous section), manually perform three cycles of the UPGMA algorithm with pen and paper.</p>
