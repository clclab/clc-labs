# Introduction

In this lab session we will implement and compare a few different rhythm distance measures. 

Ideas

* Replicate simulations in @Colannino
* Implement different distance measures for rhythms: swap distance, edit distance, etc. [see @Toussaint2002,@Thul2008]. Also an information-theory based distance measure?
* Dataset: Clave rhythms from @Thul2008 (who got them from 

Relevant papers: @Toussaint2002 distance measures and @Colannino2009: analysis of "Clapping Music"

Materials: claves.json. Clave rhythms used in @Thul2008
