# Introduction

Praat is a free and open-source computer program widely used in bioacoustics and linguistics. It is a swiss-army knife containing many tools for visualising data, analysing sounds and synthesizing sounds. It contains a scripting language that can automate all functionality of the program.

In this lab, we'll explore some of the possibilities offered by Praat.

* Means of evaluation
    * Generating and exporting figures in eps. 
    * Generating sound files (eps)

# Installing Praat

Go to [www.praat.org](www.praat.org).

Start Praat. You will see two windows: "Praat objects" and "Praat picture". At first, Praat may seem bit wonky, but don't be fooled! Praat is one of the most powerful tools for sound analysis available. 

# Frequency analysis and spectograms

* Explanation of what a spectogram is (or perhaps let them figure out themselves through questions) 
* Load the german and french baby sounds

# Fundamental frequency extraction

* Load a speech file, extract pitch contours, synthesize sound, export

# Birdsong

Go to [http://www.xeno-canto.org/]()
