abstract = {The effect of speech rate on the distinction between "slit" {\&} "split" was investigated. This distinction may be cued solely by a silent interval (SI) of sufficient duration between the /s/ {\&} /l/, {\&} the boundary SI, at which "slit" {\&} "split" are perceived with equal probability, determined. Stimuli were constructed through modification of an instance of the word "slit" spoken by a native English speaker. Ss were 2 groups of adult Fs, tested on 3 blocks of stimuli with 3 different rates of compression. Although Ss showed good identification of the stimulus categories within the range of silent intervals used, no shift in the boundary SI was found for a two-fold increase in speech rate. This finding contrasts with other recent experiments, which demonstrate "compensation" for changes in speaker characteristics such as speech rate. Results are discussed regarding several speech perception models. 2 Tables, 1 Figure. Modified HA (Copyright 1980, Sociological Abstracts, Inc., all rights reserved.)},
